        <h1>About Christopher Chen</h1>
        <p>
          Hello! I was born and raised in Southern California. For university, I attended University of California, Berkeley where I earned a B.S. in Chemical Biology. Afterwards I worked in research laboratories at Stanford University and in the biotech industry. I now attend Rithm School, a full-stack coding bootcamp as part of a career transition into software development. I enjoy hiking and boardgames and I live in New York City with my partner Sherri.
